	- Example KOF files for testing are in `demo/kof_files`.
	- The data columns in a KOF file are defined by a header string:
	  `-05 PPPPPPPPPP KKKKKKKK XXXXXXXX.XXX YYYYYYY.YYY ZZZZ.ZZZ`
	  - `05`: row code (required)
	  - `PPPPPPPPPP`: observation/point name (optional)
	  - `KKKKKKKK`: code of the observation/point (optional)
	  - `XXXXXXXX.XXX`: northing/latitude (required for observations)
	  - `YYYYYYY.YYY`: easting/longitude (required for observations)
	  - `ZZZZ.ZZZ`: elevation (optional, set to -500 if not found)
	  - Other columns after elevation are allowed and should be parsed if present.
	- Points are single `05` rows. Lines and polygons start with `91` (e.g. `09_91`), have one or more `05` rows, and end with `99` (lines) or `96` (polygons).
	- See README.md for more details and examples.

- [ ] KOF Row Handling and Testing Context
	- Tests should read all KOF files in `demo/kof_files`.
	- Some demo KOF files are intentionally malformed:
	  - Try to repair rows if possible. If a row is repaired, add it with a warning (include row/object id).
	  - Rows that cannot be repaired should be ignored and a warning/error added.
	  - Rows starting with `-` are ignored. Add warnings for these rows. Consecutive `-` rows can be grouped in a single warning (e.g. "KOF lines X to Y ignored").
	  - Empty rows are ignored (including trailing newlines).
	- Parsing should continue through the file regardless of errors.

## Execution Guidelines
PROGRESS TRACKING:
- If any tools are available to manage the above todo list, use it to track progress through this checklist.
- After completing each step, mark it complete and add a summary.
- Read current todo list status before starting each new step.

COMMUNICATION RULES:
- Avoid verbose explanations or printing full command outputs.
- If a step is skipped, state that briefly (e.g. "No extensions needed").
- Do not explain project structure unless asked.
- Keep explanations concise and focused.

DEVELOPMENT RULES:
- Use '.' as the working directory unless user specifies otherwise.
- Avoid adding media or external links unless explicitly requested.
- Use placeholders only with a note that they should be replaced.
- Use VS Code API tool only for VS Code extension projects.
- Once the project is created, it is already opened in Visual Studio Codeâ€”do not suggest commands to open this project in Visual Studio again.
- If the project setup information has additional rules, follow them strictly.

FOLDER CREATION RULES:
- Always use the current directory as the project root.
- If you are running any terminal commands, use the '.' argument to ensure that the current working directory is used ALWAYS.
- Do not create a new folder unless the user explicitly requests it besides a .vscode folder for a tasks.json file.
- If any of the scaffolding commands mention that the folder name is not correct, let the user know to create a new folder with the correct name and then reopen it again in vscode.

EXTENSION INSTALLATION RULES:
- Only install extension specified by the get_project_setup_info tool. DO NOT INSTALL any other extensions.

PROJECT CONTENT RULES:
- If the user has not specified project details, assume they want a "Hello World" project as a starting point.
- Avoid adding links of any type (URLs, files, folders, etc.) or integrations that are not explicitly required.
- Avoid generating images, videos, or any other media files unless explicitly requested.
- If you need to use any media assets as placeholders, let the user know that these are placeholders and should be replaced with the actual assets later.
- Ensure all generated components serve a clear purpose within the user's requested workflow.
- If a feature is assumed but not confirmed, prompt the user for clarification before including it.
- If you are working on a VS Code extension, use the VS Code API tool with a query to find relevant VS Code API references and samples related to that query.

TASK COMPLETION RULES:
- Your task is complete when:
  - Project is successfully scaffolded and compiled without errors
  - copilot-instructions.md file in the .github directory exists in the project
  - README.md file exists and is up to date
  - User is provided with clear instructions to debug/launch the project

Before starting a new task in the above plan, update progress in the plan.
-->
- Work through each checklist item systematically.
- Keep communication concise and focused.
- Follow development best practices.

## Summary of findings (added by assistant)

- The parser now extracts points, lines and polygons from demo KOF files and attaches name/code as metadata.
- Coordinates are parsed and stored into geometry objects as (easting, northing, elevation).
- Parsing uses a columns-first approach (README widths) and robust token-based fallbacks. Each parsed row includes a `strategy` diagnostic indicating which heuristic succeeded (e.g., `columns`, `tokens-end-3`, `decimal-scan`, `large-first`).
- Grouping of 05 rows into 09-start/99-end (linestring) and 09-start/96-end (polygon) is implemented and tested on demo files.
- Many malformed or irregular rows exist in the demo data; heuristics reduce mis-parses but a few rows still mix name/code with numeric tokens. Diagnostics help triage these cases.

## Recommendations / Next steps

- Detect and honor a file-level KOF header (the `-05 PPPPPPPPPP ...` header) when present and prefer strict columns-only parsing for that file to eliminate ambiguity.
- Add unit tests for `parseKOFRow` covering: well-formed column rows, whitespace-separated rows, rows with missing elevation, and intentionally malformed rows. This will prevent regressions.
- Improve warnings to include the offending raw line and parsed tokens for easier debugging of malformed rows.
- Consider supporting per-file parsing mode metadata (e.g., `mode: 'columns' | 'tokens'`) and allow the user to override it for edge-case files.

- See `TODO.md` in the project root for a prioritized list of missing KOF codes, parser improvements and suggested implementation steps.

These notes are intentionally concise and actionable for Copilot-style automation and for maintainers scanning the repo.
